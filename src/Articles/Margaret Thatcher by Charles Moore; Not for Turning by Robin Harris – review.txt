How much more is there to say about Margaret Thatcher? That these biographies have the same phrase in their title is not a promising start. Nor is it a title – taken from one of her most self-mythologising moments, her studiedly defiant speech to the doubting 1980 Conservative conference – that suggests these heavy volumes will be leavened with too much fresh or independent thinking. Robin Harris worked with Thatcher, often "closely" in his words, for a quarter of a century from the late 70s, as a speechwriter, ghostwriter, adviser, organiser and diehard supporter. In her memoirs, she calls him "my indispensable sherpa". Charles Moore has been one of Britain's best-known rightwing journalists for equally long. Since Thatcher's death, he has seemed happy to mix his promotional duties as an author with defending her against, as he put it on Question Time, "People who are horrible … promoting the idea that she is [sic] very divisive."
