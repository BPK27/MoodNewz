Almost 1.5 million women could be unemployed by 2018 if the government's current plans for job growth continue as planned, according to a new survey.
Women's unemployment is rising to a 25-year-high, while men's is decreasing, with 60% of new private-sector jobs since the first quarter of 2010 going to men.
The report by the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality on pay, pensions, poverty, justice and politics, found that almost three times as many women as men have become long-term unemployed in the last two and a half years: 103,000 women compared with 37,000 men.
The report found that women have not only already borne the brunt of cuts to the public-sector workforce but that, with 75% of the cuts yet to be felt, the future is even bleaker.
Ceri Goddard, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: "The labour market is in the midst of enormous change. Almost a million jobs are being cut from the public sector but the government's various plans for growth continue to leave many women behind, with the majority of new jobs being created in the private sector going to men.
"At the same time, those women who do find work in this sector are likely to face lower wages and a wider gender pay gap," she said.
